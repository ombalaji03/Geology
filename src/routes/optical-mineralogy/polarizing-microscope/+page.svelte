    <Paragraph
        text="Identification of rocks or minerals cam be challenging when studied as hand specimen. Additional parameters other than their physical properties are required. For this reason we need to study the optical properties of minerals as well."

    <Paragraph
        text="The fundamental principle of optical microscropy is that most minerals or rocks, even the ones which appear opaque in hand specimen, transmit light if they are sliced thin enough. For these minerals the study of their optical properties are conducted by transmited light microscopy. Polarizing microscope or petrographic microscope is used for this purpose."

    <Paragraph
        text="On the other hand, some minerals do not allow transmission of light even when their thin sections are prepared. For these opaque minerals, their optical properties are studied via a technique known as reflected light microscopy"

    In practice these specially prepared thin sections are around 30 micro
    meters thin.
